## Beta
The EnviroAtlas Intelligent Dasymetric Toolbox for Open Source GIS is currently in development. The most recent release for ESRI ArcMap 10.3 is available at [https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/dasymetric-toolbox](https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/dasymetric-toolbox).

## Overview
Dasymetric mapping is a geospatial technique that uses information such as land cover types to more accurately distribute data within selected boundaries like census blocks.

The Intelligent Dasymetric Mapping (IDM) Toolbox is available to download. This toolbox uses Python 3.6 and open source GIS libraries. An additional version is available as a [toolbox for ESRI ArcGIS Pro](https://github.com/USEPA/Dasymetric-Toolbox-ArcGISPro)

-   EnviroAtlas researchers use the dasymetric data to calculate the distribution of ecosystem services, and other metrics including walking distances, viewsheds, resource use, and exposure potential.
-   For more information on the Dasymetric data created for EnviroAtlas, see our [website](https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/dasymetric-toolbox) or  [Dasymetric Allocation of Population Fact Sheet](https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/enviroatlas/DataFactSheets/pdf/Supplemental/DasymetricAllocationofPopulation.pdf).


## Installation
To install this application you will need Python 3.6 and several libraries. A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html) environment file is provided.
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/USEPA/Dasymetric-Toolbox-OpenSource

# Go into the repository
$ cd Dasymetric-Toolbox-OpenSource

# create environment
$ conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate environment
$ source activate idm 
# for Windows use [conda activate idm]

# Run the app
$ python idm.py --help
```

## Usage
```
idm.py [-h] [uninhabited_file] [minimum_sampling_area] [minimum_sample] 
[percent] [pop_nodata] [anc_nodata] population_features 
population_count_field population_key_field ancillary_raster output_directory 
```
### Description
-h, --help  
Description and explanation of arguments

uninhabited_file (optional)
An optional feature class containing uninhabited areas

minimum_sampling_area
The minimum number of raster cells in a source polygon for it to be considered representative 
of a class - default = 1

minimum_sample
The minimum number of source units to ensure a representative sample for a land cover class - default = 3

percent
The minimum percent of a source polygon's area that an ancillary class must cover in order for 
the source polygon to be considered representative of that class. Please enter as a decimal - default = 0.95

pop_nodata
The population_features will be converted to raster and this will be the NoData value - default = 0

anc_nodata  
The NoData value for the ancillary raster - default = 0

population_features  
Path to polygon shapefile with unique identifiers and a count of the population for each polygon

population_count_field  
The field in the population_features that stores the polygon's populations

population_key_field  
The unique identifier field (must be positive whole numbers) for each polygon in population_features.  

ancillary_raster  
Path to categorical raster (e.g., GeoTiff) containing classes that are indicative of the spatial distribution of population (e.g., land cover). 

output_directory  
Path where all outputs from the script will be saved.

### Preset Densities
The user can set a population density for any ancillary class using their own domain knowledge by modifying the 'config.json' file in the toolbox's root directory. 

The preset densities for the following land cover classes from the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) are set to 0 people per pixel:

* 11, Open Water
* 12, Perennial Ice/Snow
* 95, Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands


### Examples
[Example data](data) are provided.
```bash
mkdir -p output
python idm.py ./data/2010_blocks_DE.shp POP10 polyID ./data/nlcd_2011_DE.tif ./output
```
Running the script with uninhabited polygons
```bash
mkdir -p output
python idm.py --uninhabited_file uninhab_DE.shp ./data/2010_blocks_DE.shp POP10 polyID ./data/nlcd_2011_DE.tif ./output
```

## Credits
The Intelligent Dasymetric Toolbox for ArcGIS Pro was developed for [EnviroAtlas](https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas). EnviroAtlas is a collaborative effort led by U.S. EPA that provides geospatial data, easy-to-use tools, and other resources related to ecosystem services, their stressors, and human health. 

The dasymetric  toolbox using open source GIS was developed in January 2020 by **Anam Khan**<sup>1</sup> and **Jeremy Baynes**<sup>2</sup>. This release also introduced optional functionality to mask known uninhabited areas.

The toolbox was originally developed for ArcMap 10 by **Torrin Hultgren**<sup>3</sup> 

The dasymetric toolbox follows the the methods by **Mennis and Hultgren (2006)**<sup>4</sup>.
